# Land-spill example: utah_dem_opt

This folder contains an example of overland flow with one point source that
continues leaking fluid into the computational domain. The simulation itself is
exactly the same as the example ***utah_dem***. The difference is in the 
Makefile. In this example, we use the Fortran code that is slightly optimized 
for overland flows.

The usage is exactly the same as the ***utah_dem*** example.
